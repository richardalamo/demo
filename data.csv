0,"How does the RFP differentiate between mandatory and preferred contractual provisions, and what are the implications for a proponent if they fail to explicitly address a preferred provision in their proposal?","The RFP distinguishes between **mandatory** and **preferred contractual provisions** as follows:

1. **Mandatory Provisions**:
   - Cannot be modified by the proponent in their proposal.
   - Are automatically incorporated by reference into any submitted proposal and the resulting contract.
   - Non-compliance or failure to address these may result in disqualification or rejection of the proposal, as they are non-negotiable.

2. **Preferred Provisions**:
   - Are desirable to USask but **not binding** unless explicitly accepted by the proponent.
   - Proponents may **reject or amend** these provisions by clearly stating their objections or proposed changes in their submission.
   - If a proponent **fails to explicitly address a preferred provision** (either by rejecting, amending, or accepting it), the provision is **automatically deemed accepted** and incorporated into the contract by default.
   - This ""silence as acceptance"" rule means proponents must actively review and respond to preferred provisions to avoid unintended contractual obligations.

**Implications for Proponents**:
- **Risk of Unintended Commitments**: If a preferred provision is not explicitly addressed, the proponent may be bound to terms they did not negotiate or intend to accept, potentially leading to operational, financial, or legal challenges post-award.
- **Evaluation Impact**: Under **Section 1.17 (Selection Criteria)**, the ""willingness to accommodate USask requirements & acceptance of preferred contractual provisions"" is weighted (5 points under **Proponent Qualifications**). Failure to engage with preferred provisions could negatively affect the proposal’s score, reducing competitiveness.
- **Limited Post-Submission Negotiation**: Once incorporated by default, preferred provisions cannot be renegotiated later. Proponents lose the opportunity to clarify or modify terms after submission unless USask initiates discussions (which is discretionary per **Section 1.17**).
- **Contractual Flexibility**: Explicitly rejecting or amending preferred provisions allows proponents to align the contract with their operational capabilities or risk appetite, but such changes may be evaluated during the selection process.

**Key Action for Proponents**:
- **Explicitly state** in the proposal whether each preferred provision is accepted, rejected, or modified.
- Provide **justification** for any rejected/amended provisions to strengthen the proposal’s evaluation under **Section 1.17** (e.g., demonstrating alternative solutions that meet USask’s objectives).
- Ensure alignment with **Section 3.0 (Contractual Provisions)** and **Appendix B** to avoid gaps in compliance.","USask shall not be bound and the Proponents agree not to rely upon any written or verbal statements or 
representations of any other persons, whether employed by USask or not, in the preparation and 
submission of their Proposals.  This RFP, and any subsequent modifications thereto, is designated as the 
sole reference for the preparation of Proposals and takes precedence over any and all information 
obtained from any source, either verbal or written.  All addenda will be issued, posted to

1.18 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION 
 
USask has outlined both mandatory and preferred contractual provisions (see Section 3.0 – Contractual 
Provisions and Appendix B – Validation of Proposal and Acceptance of Contractual Provisions) that will 
govern the selection of a Proponent(s) and any subsequent Contract issued.  These contractual terms 
will be incorporated into any Contract between the successful Proponent(s) and USask.  
Mandatory contractual provisions cannot be modified in the Proponent's Proposal and shall be deemed to 
be specifically incorporated by reference in any Proposal submitted by the Proponent(s).  Preferred 
contractual provisions are desirable to USask but may be modified upon request.  A Proponent may reject 
or make changes to the preferred contractual provisions by explicitly stating so in their Proposal.  The 
change will be considered in the selection process .  Preferred contractual provisions not explicitly 
rejected or amended by a Proponent, shall be incorporated by reference in any submitted Proposal 
without further opportunity to comment or amend by the Proponent.   
 
UNLESS A PROPONENT EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES OTHERWISE IN THEIR 
WRITTEN SUBMISSION, THE PROPOSAL SHALL AUTOMATICALLY BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE THE 
PROPONENT’S AGREEMENT TO THE PREFERRED CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS OF THIS RFP.  IF 
A PROPONENT CANNOT ACCEPT ANY OF THESE PROVISIONS, THE PROPONENT MUST SET 
OUT THE OBJECTION IN THEIR PROPOSAL.  FAILING WHICH, ALL PREFERRED CONTRACTUAL 
PROVISIONS SHALL BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE CONTRACT.;USask is under no obligation to award a Contract and reserves the right to terminate the Proposal 
process at any time, and to withdraw from discussions with any or all of the Proponents who have 
responded.

1,"Under the ""Service and Maintenance"" section, what specific metrics or evidence should a vendor provide to substantiate their claimed uptime percentage, and how should they document their remote monitoring processes to ensure transparency?","To substantiate claimed uptime percentages under the **""Service and Maintenance""** section, vendors should provide the following **metrics and evidence**, along with transparent documentation of their **remote monitoring processes**:

### **1. Metrics/Evidence for Uptime Claims**
- **Historical Uptime Reports**:
  - **Monthly/Quarterly/Annual uptime logs** (e.g., 99.9% over the past 12 months), including:
    - Scheduled vs. unscheduled downtime breakdowns.
    - Root cause analysis (RCA) for outages exceeding SLA thresholds.
    - Third-party audit reports (e.g., ISO 27001, SSAE 18, or CSA STAR certifications) validating uptime claims.
  - **Real-time dashboards** (e.g., via a customer portal) showing live system status, incident logs, and resolution timelines.

- **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance Data**:
  - **Downtime penalties**: Documentation of financial credits or remedial actions triggered for SLA breaches (e.g., ""For every 0.1% below 99.9% uptime, a 5% service credit is applied"").
  - **Incident Response Metrics**:
    - Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR), and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
    - Escalation procedures for critical incidents (e.g., 24/7 on-call support tiers).

- **Redundancy and Failover Testing**:
  - **Disaster Recovery (DR) drill reports**: Frequency (e.g., quarterly), success rates, and recovery time objectives (RTOs).
  - **Geographic redundancy**: Proof of multi-region data center deployments with automated failover (e.g., active-active clusters).

- **Backup and Restoration Validation**:
  - **Backup success rates**: Logs confirming daily/weekly backups are completed without corruption.
  - **Restoration tests**: Documentation of periodic (e.g., monthly) tests to verify data recoverability within claimed timeframes (e.g., ""Full system restore in ≤4 hours"").

---

### **2. Remote Monitoring Process Documentation**
To ensure transparency, vendors must document the following aspects of their **remote monitoring**:

- **Monitoring Tools and Coverage**:
  - **Tools used**: Specify platforms (e.g., Nagios, Datadog, Splunk) and their configurations (e.g., synthetic transactions, heartbeat checks).
  - **Scope**: List monitored components (e.g., servers, APIs, databases, network latency) and their health thresholds (e.g., CPU >90% triggers alerts).
  - **Alerting Workflows**:
    - **Escalation paths**: Tiered notifications (e.g., email for warnings, SMS/call for critical failures).
    - **Stakeholder access**: Provide read-only portal access for the university to view real-time alerts and resolution statuses.

- **Data Collection and Retention**:
  - **Logs retained**: Duration (e.g., 90 days for performance logs, 1 year for security events) and storage security (e.g., encrypted, immutable).
  - **Audit trails**: Timestamped records of all monitoring actions (e.g., ""Alert acknowledged by [Engineer] at [Time]"").

- **Transparency Mechanisms**:
  - **Scheduled reports**: Automated monthly/quarterly summaries of uptime, incidents, and remediation actions (aligned with **Section 3.22 REPORTS**).
  - **Ad-hoc audit support**: Commitment to provide raw monitoring data upon request (per **Section 3.21 AUDITS**).
  - **Change management logs**: Documentation of all maintenance windows, patches, or configuration changes (with pre-notification per **Section 3.20 PAYMENT TERMS**).

- **Third-Party Validation**:
  - **Independent audits**: Reports from certified bodies (e.g., SOC 2 Type II) attesting to monitoring effectiveness.
  - **Penetration test results**: Shared upon request (per **Part VI, Question 4**), including remediation timelines for vulnerabilities.

2,"In Appendix D (Pricing Structure), what criteria does the RFP specify for vendors to qualify for volume discounts, and how should these discounts be structured in relation to the number of users or other usage metrics?","The RFP specifies that **volume discounts** in **Appendix D (Pricing Structure)** are tied to **tiered pricing models based on the number of users** under the **Volume Licensing with Tiered Pricing** option. Key criteria and structuring requirements include:

1. **Qualification Criteria**:
   - Vendors must offer **cost savings through volume licensing** when the University of Saskatchewan (USask) commits to a higher number of users.
   - The pricing tiers should align with **user thresholds**, allowing USask to scale discounts as user adoption increases.
   - Vendors must support **flexibility to transition between pricing models** (e.g., switching from individual subscriptions to volume licensing) if user counts exceed predefined thresholds.

2. **Discount Structure**:
   - Discounts should be **tiered**, with clear breaks (e.g., 1–500 users, 501–2,000 users, 2,000+ users) and corresponding per-user or per-subscription price reductions.
   - The RFP explicitly mentions the need for a **detailed pricing model** attached to the proposal, including:
     - **Per-user licensing costs** (annual or monthly, in CAD, excluding GST/PST).
     - **Token-based pricing thresholds** (if applicable), with examples of average monthly token consumption per user and any additional costs incurred beyond thresholds.
     - **Enterprise management fees** (e.g., SSO setup, API-based provisioning) if bundled with volume licensing.
   - Vendors must clarify whether discounts apply to **all cost types** (e.g., subscriptions, implementation, training) or only specific line items.

3. **Additional Requirements**:
   - The proposal must outline the **University’s ability to combine agreement options** (e.g., mixing individual subscriptions with volume licensing for different user groups).
   - Vendors should describe how **existing USask subscribers** under other agreements can be onboarded into the volume-licensed tier without disruption.
   - **Optional Extension Year Pricing** (Years 6–10) must reflect sustained or escalating discounts for long-term commitments.

4. **Transparency & Assumptions**:
   - Vendors must list **assumptions influencing pricing** (e.g., user growth projections, token usage patterns) and how these might affect discount eligibility.
   - Any **throttling or overage costs** triggered by exceeding usage metrics (e.g., tokens, API calls) must be disclosed upfront.

**Example Structure for Tiered Discounts** (hypothetical, based on RFP guidance):
| **User Tier**       | **Per-User/Year (CAD)** | **Discount** | **Notes**                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| 1–500 users         | $X                      | 0%           | Base rate                          |
| 501–2,000 users     | $(X-10%)                | 10%          | Volume threshold 1                 |
| 2,000+ users        | $(X-20%)                | 20%          | Volume threshold 2                 |
| Enterprise (10K+)   | Custom                  | 25%+         | Includes SSO/API management        |

**Key References**:
- **Section B.3 (Appendix D)**: Highlights ""Volume Licensing with Tiered Pricing"" as a preferred model for cost savings.
- **Pricing Structure Table (Page 27)**: Requires vendors to populate tiered pricing for ""Individual Subscription"" and ""Enterprise Management"" across 10 years.
- **Token-Based Model Note**: Discounts may also apply to token bundles if usage metrics are tied to user tiers.","Additionally, they 
should indicate whether any volume discounts are available based on the number of users. 
Pricing structure should be shown in Canadian dollars, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and 
Provincial Sales Tax (PST) excluded. Add additional line items to this Pricing Structure as 
necessary. 
*If costs are monthly, please include information within your Proposal’s pricing structure.  
** Provide usage examples of how many tokens an average user consumes in a given month.

APPENDIX E: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE VENDOR FORM     
(If Applicable, this form cannot be revised) 
 
Software as a Service (SaaS) Vendor Form 
Part I: General Information 
In order to protect the institution and its systems, vendors whose products and/or services will access and/or 
host institutional data must complete the SaaS Vendor Form.  Throughout this form, anywhere where the term 
data is used, this is an all-encompassing term including at least data and metadata.  Institution security analysts, 
privacy specialists, and enterprise architects will review answers upon submittal.;B.3 Agreement Options 
 
The University is interested in exploring flexible agreement options, including: 
 Enterprise Management with Individual Subscriptions: Setting up and managing the AI platform 
infrastructure while allowing individual faculty, staff, and students to purchase their own 
subscriptions. This approach relies on the vendor to provide capabilities to enroll new USask 
subscribers under the USask Enterprise/Education Agreement and enable Single Sign On (SSO) 
for those users.  
 Volume Licensing with Tiered Pricing: Securing cost savings through volume licensing with tiered 
pricing based on the number of users. This approach relies on USask managing the enrollment of 
USask subscribers under the USask Enterprise/Education Agreement and providing USask users 
with Single Sign On (SSO). USask would manage account & role provisioning, preferably through 
the vendor’s API. 
For each of the flexible agreement options above, the University would also like to understand: 
 the Proponent’s recommended approach for onboarding existing USask subscribers under other 
agreements to a USask Enterprise/Education Agreement. 
 the University’s ability to move between flexible pricing options based on user thresholds. 
 The University’s ability to have a combination of agreement options available for USask users.

   - **Obtain the necessary rights** for USask to continue using the software legally.

2. **Refund and Removal**: If an injunction prevents USask from using the software, the Service Provider is obligated to:
   - **Take back** the infringing software, and
   - **Refund the total amount** USask has paid for it.

**Alternatives for Resolution**:
While the section does not explicitly outline alternatives, the broader RFP framework suggests the following dispute resolution mechanisms (per **Section 3.25 – Alternate Dispute Resolution**), which could apply to copyright claims:
- **Mediation**: Both parties must meet promptly to resolve the dispute, optionally engaging a mediator (costs shared equally).
- **Arbitration**: If mediation fails, either party can request binding arbitration under *The Arbitration Act, 1992* (Saskatchewan), with the arbitrator’s decision being final.

Additionally, the Service Provider could propose **technical or contractual alternatives** such as:
- Replacing the disputed software with a non-infringing equivalent at no additional cost to USask.
- Offering a **license indemnification clause** to cover legal risks for USask.
- Implementing **content filtering or AI guardrails** to mitigate future infringement risks.
